        Hi, I am a freshman computer science student at CU Boulder.

    <h3>Philosphy of Education</h3>
      <p>   
	      Education is both an opportunity and an investment. It is an opportunity that is seen as the stepping stone into a well-paying
        career while at the same time is an investment in myself, my knowledge, and my growth as a human being. I believe that my time 
        at the University of Colorado will not only advance my knowledge of my computer science major and open doors for my professional 
        life, but will also help me understand myself, build goals for my future, and hopefully allow me to use my talents to positively 
        affect the lives of those around me. Education to me is something that is always occurring in life. Everyday, people come across 
        new ideas, opinions, and thoughts and have to decide how best to implement them into their life. It is a gradual process that is 
        always incomplete. No matter how much mastery an individual has of a certain topic, there will always be other subjects to learn. 
        But the beauty of education is that we can choose what we want to learn and what we don’t care to learn, and this allows for an 
        individual’s unique passions to shine through. Education sets us apart from the rest of the animal kingdom; it enables us to reach
        for greater goals and push the limits of our potential. It empowers humans to be creative, competitive, and drive the progress of 
        the entire human race. Personally, I want to be thoroughly tested to the limits of my ability at CU; I want classes that challenge 
        me to master material that I had no idea I possessed the capability to learn. This is why I place so much value on education, 
        because it allows me to look back on all the time I have spent to grasp a concept and allows me to attach a value to my mastery of
        it because learning usually rewards hard work and effort. Furthermore, I want to approach every semester with grit and determination
        and not fall into the motions of “just another semester”. I have noticed that a lot of people and sometimes even myself just wish that
        we could fast forward through the difficult parts of schooling and get to their future job and I need to discontinue with that mindset.
        I want to embrace those difficulties as a part of my growth and realize that I can either make the best of the hardships I’ll face in 
        learning some material or apathetically cruise through the course never fully giving my best effort. I believe that the purpose of 
        education in my life will be to provide new opportunities, help me prove to myself that I am capable of understanding complex concepts,
        and give me a strong basis of confidence as I enter the job world. In today’s world, a lot of jobs come with the requirement of a 
        college degree, and after attaining that I feel as though I will have not only achieved a great personal feat but also will be “worthy”
        in the eyes of an employer. Through the amount of difficult classes I will have taken by the time I graduate, I hope to be prepared for
        the problems I will encounter in the “real world” and this readiness will transfer into confidence.  Although I know the unlikelihood
        of me impacting the whole world or even millions of people, I hope that education will enable me to personally impact the lives of 
        other people in a positive way. Ultimately, education aids individuals in understanding themselves and the people around them and 
        allows for the development of the human race.
